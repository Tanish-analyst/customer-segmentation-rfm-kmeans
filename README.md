# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation in Retail Using RFM and KMeans

This project uses real-world e-commerce data (UCI Online Retail Dataset) to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using RFM analysis and KMeans clustering. The goal is to help businesses identify VIPs, low spenders, and at-risk customers — and tailor strategies for retention, engagement, and growth.

## 🔍 Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses personalize marketing, optimize resource allocation, and boost profitability. In this project, I used RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features and applied KMeans clustering to discover meaningful customer segments.

## 🏢 Business Context

For e-commerce and retail businesses, not all customers hold equal value. Identifying VIPs versus one-time or disengaged customers allows companies to:

- Launch targeted campaigns
- Improve customer retention
- Boost lifetime value

## 🧠 Key Results

- Identified 3 segments:
  - **VIP Customers**
  - **Low Spenders**
  - **At-Risk Customers**
- Each cluster interpreted based on RFM scores and visualized with pie/bar charts

Highlights:

- **VIPs (19.9%)** → High spenders, great retention potential  
- **Low Spenders (68.5%)** → Frequent but low-value buyers; upsell potential  
- **At-Risk (11.5%)** → Previously active customers now disengaged
